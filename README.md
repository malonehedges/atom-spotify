# atom-spotify

This is somewhat of a fork of [atomify](https://github.com/jaebradley/atomify) by [Jae Bradley](https://github.com/jaebradley). I didn't like a few things and chose to rewrite to get the exact functionality that I wanted.

## Installation

To install, enter the following command:

```bash
apm install malonehedges/atom-spotify
```
